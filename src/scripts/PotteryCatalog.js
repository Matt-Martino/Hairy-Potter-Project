Pricing Uncracked Pottery
Create a scripts/PotteryCatalog.js module.
Define a variable in the module with a value of an empty array. This array will store pottery that will be sold. Do not export this array.
Define and export a function named toSellOrNotToSell that is responsible for determining if a piece of pottery should be sold.
The toSellOrNotToSell function must accept a pottery object as input.
If the weight of the piece of pottery is greater than, or equal to, 6 then the function must add a price property with a value of 40.
If the weight of the piece of pottery is less than 6 then the function must add a price property with a value of 20.
If the piece of pottery is cracked, do not add a price property to it.
If the pottery is not cracked, add the object to the module-level array of items to be sold.
Return the augmented object.
Define and export a function named usePottery returns a copy of the array of items to be sold. Recall which array method creates a copy of the array.
